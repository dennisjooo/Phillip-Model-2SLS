In this project, we tried to analyze how some economics variable might affect the Consumer Price Index and the Wage of the people of the United States of America. The model that we were using is based on that created by an economist called William Phillips), it is considered as a Simultaneous Equation Model (a model in which the dependend variables are intertwined with one another). We tested if the given model is indeed the best model for the scenario.

For Consumer Price Index ($\dot{P}_t$), Unemployment Rate ($\dot{UN}_t$), Money Wages ($\dot{W}_t$), Prices of Imported Raw Material ($\dot{R}_t$), the data was procured from [United States Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://data.bls.gov/), while Cost of Capital was be taken from [NYU Stern School of Businesses](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/wacc.html). We observed data from 2006 up to 2021.
